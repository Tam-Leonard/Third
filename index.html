               Chicago is one of my favorite cities to visit. A three-hour plane ride, or 8-hour drive, is a short trip for major adventures and to experience big city life. 
               Summer is my favorite time to visit. My traveling companions are usually my sister and mother.
               On a sweltering day in August, we found ourselves at our usual stop on the Miracle Mile, the longest shopping district in downtown Chicago, the Nike store. 
               The store has three levels filled with Nike shoes, accessories, and gear for every sport Nike sponsors. 
               There are also rare and hard to purchase sneakers sold in the store. After carefully browsing their supply from top to bottom, my mother, sister, and I were exiting the store when we were told that there was an exclusive exhibit of Virgil Abloh’s work with Nike next door.

            Virgil Abloh was a historic architect, fashion designer, entrepreneur, musician, artists, and philanthropist from Rockford, IL and lived in Chicago at the end of his life. 
            As fans of his work and his cultural impact on mainstream fashion, my sister and I jumped at the opportunity to see the exhibition. 
            When we entered, we were immediately transformed into a multisensory experience of Virgil’s creative process. We saw samples of his work and completed projects with Nike.

            Every trip to Chicago my family and I come across something new. That day, we just happened to be at the right place at the right time to witness a legendary artist’s work.
            The most special part of the exhibit was hearing audio recordings of Virgil explaining his purpose or, what I like to call the why. 
            It was transformative and inspiring. Virgil transitioned a few years after our visit to his exhibition and is now an ancestor. 
            One of the many things I learned that I often repeat to myself when coding gets tough and my why seems out of reach are four words from Virgil Abloh, “You can do it too.”
